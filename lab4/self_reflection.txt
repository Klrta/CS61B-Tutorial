All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 
一.设置了private static final int变量,分别是初始长度,增长因数,下降因数,在编写初定义这些变量会少很多麻烦
二.public class ArrayDeque<T> 使用泛型,得以让数据结构接受所有数据类型


Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:
画出图后,我把start和end视作两个指针,增删改查的操作只需根据指针和 定义的变量来进行,很方便
arr = (T[]) new Object[INITIAL_LENGTH];  这个是构造函数里的一步,难想

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:
暂时没有发现

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A:
没有同伴

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A:
希望明白数据结构在增删改查时是怎么变化的,如果有动画演示会好理解

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:

类之后可以嵌套类,我希望自己要记住,
可以想象一下,最大的类是框架,其余是补充

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: 喜欢
